# ESP32 Arduino.

### 1)Create WiFi Hotspot. 
### 2)Using 4 channels ADC(12 bits) internal DSP(10 uP capacitor and average sampling), connecting to tensosensor.
### 3) Using 2 I2C connecting to MAX30102, because every sensor have similar ID.
### 4)Send data packet from 4 tensosensors and 2 MAX30102 via UDP.
